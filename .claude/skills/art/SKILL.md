## 🔀 ROUTING: Which Workflow to Use?

### **🎯 Visualize (ADAPTIVE ORCHESTRATOR)** → `workflows/visualize.md`
**When to use:**
- User says 'visualize this', 'create visualization', 'what's the best way to show this'
- Content has multiple dimensions (data + narrative + concepts)
- User says 'infographic', 'dashboard', 'data viz', 'mixed media'
- You're not sure which single workflow fits (let Visualize analyze and choose)
- Need to combine approaches (data + metaphor, charts + illustrations)
- Want optimal visualization strategy, not predetermined format

**Key:** Intelligent analysis → strategic combination → professional infographics/dashboards

## Quick Decision Tree

```
What does user need?

├─ Unsure which approach? Complex multi-dimensional content? → VISUALIZE (analyzes & orchestrates)
├─ Infographic/dashboard/data viz with multiple elements? → VISUALIZE
├─ Flowchart/sequence/state diagram with Excalidraw sketchy feel? → MERMAID
├─ Abstract metaphor for article? → Editorial Illustration
├─ System/architecture with labels? → Technical Diagram
├─ Categories organized in grid? → Taxonomy
├─ Change over time? → Timeline
├─ 2x2 matrix or mental model? → Framework
├─ Side-by-side contrast? → Comparison
├─ Markup existing screenshot? → Annotated Screenshot
├─ Step-by-step process? → Recipe Card
├─ Quote as social visual? → Aphorism
├─ Idea territories as map? → Conceptual Map
├─ Single striking number? → Stat Card
└─ Multi-panel story? → Comic

NOTE: Visualize is the ORCHESTRATOR - it can choose and combine any of the 13 specialized workflows
NOTE: Mermaid = structured diagram types (flowchart, sequence, state, etc.) + Excalidraw whiteboard aesthetic
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW — EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATIONS

**This section describes the EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATION workflow. For TECHNICAL DIAGRAMS, see `workflows/technical-diagrams.md`**

**CRITICAL: These steps are MANDATORY and must be executed IN ORDER. Do NOT skip steps. Do NOT make up your own process.**

### Step 0: Read Required Files (MANDATORY)
1. **Read workflow:** `workflows/workflow.md` (editorial) OR `workflows/technical-diagrams.md` (technical)
2. **Read aesthetic:** `~/.claude/skills/CORE/aesthetic.md`

### Step 1: Run 24-Item Story Explanation on Content (MANDATORY)
**You MUST use the story-explanation skill with 24-item length. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT derive concepts yourself without the 24-item story explanation.**

```
Use story-explanation skill with 24-item length for [content or URL]
```

The 24-item output gives you the FULL narrative arc: setup, tension, transformation, resolution.

### Step 2: Derive Visual Metaphor from FULL NARRATIVE ARC (MANDATORY)
Only AFTER running 24-item story explanation, derive ONE visual metaphor that captures the JOURNEY/TRANSFORMATION/PROCESS using ALL 24 items (not just the final item).

### Step 3-6: Continue with workflow.md
Follow the remaining steps in `workflows/workflow.md` exactly.

---

### Aesthetic Source (REQUIRED READING)

**Always read first:** `~/.claude/skills/CORE/aesthetic.md`

This defines the Anthropic editorial style:
- Flat solid colors (NO gradients)
- Hand-drawn black linework (imperfect, gestural)
- Muted earth-tone backgrounds (cream, terracotta, sage, peach)
- Abstract conceptual metaphors
- 30-40% negative space

---

## Color System

### Background
- **WHITE #FFFFFF** for generation → **remove.bg** creates TRANSPARENCY
- Final images have transparent background (blog CSS applies sepia)

### Primary: Black Linework
- **Pure Black #000000** — DOMINANT, carries the entire composition

### Accent Colors (MUST BE VISIBLE - not primary fills)
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Deep Purple | #4A148C | Brand accent - REQUIRED and MUST BE NOTICEABLE |
| Deep Teal | #00796B | Secondary accent option |
| Charcoal | #2D2D2D | Kai signature, subtle details |

**CRITICAL COLOR REQUIREMENT:**
- Purple (#4A148C) MUST be visible and noticeable in every image
- "Accent" means visible color, NOT microscopic hints
- Color should be immediately apparent when viewing the image
- If you can't see the purple/teal without zooming in, it's TOO SUBTLE
- Balance: Not dominant, but definitely present and visible

### Color Hierarchy
1. **BLACK LINEWORK is PRIMARY** — dominates composition
2. **Purple as ACCENT** — hints/details, NOT solid fills, but MUST BE VISIBLE
3. **Secondary accent** — sparingly, but noticeable
4. **No gradients, no shadows**
5. **COLOR VALIDATION** — Must pass visual inspection for color presence

---

## Core Visual Rules

1. **Background:** Single flat muted earth tone
2. **Style:** Hand-drawn, gestural black linework — NOT smooth vectors
3. **Composition:** Full-bleed edge-to-edge, elements fill 100% of frame (NO whitespace or margins)
4. **Aspect Ratio:** Square 1:1 format (NOT 16:9 rectangle)
5. **Elements:** 2-3 abstract elements maximum
6. **Lines:** Variable weight, imperfect, wobbly, brush-like texture
7. **NO TEXT** (except Kai signature)
8. **KAI SIGNATURE:** Small subtle "Kai" in charcoal (#2D2D2D) bottom right
9. **COLOR PRESENCE:** Purple (#4A148C) and/or Teal (#00796B) MUST be visible and noticeable as accents

---

## Style Direction

### Think
- Saul Steinberg (New Yorker)
- Matisse cutouts
- Christoph Niemann (Abstract Sunday)
- Risograph editorial aesthetic

### AVOID
- Gradients or shading
- Glossy/shiny surfaces
- 3D rendering
- Photorealistic elements
- Smooth perfect vector lines
- "AI slop" (too perfect, too shiny)
- Cartoonish or clip-art

---

## Environment Setup

The CLI automatically loads API keys from `~/.claude/.env`. Required keys:
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - For Flux and Nano Banana models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT-image-1 model
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)
- `REMOVEBG_API_KEY` - For background removal

---

## Default Model

**nano-banana-pro** (Gemini 3 Pro)

```bash
bun run ~/.claude/skills/art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output /path/to/output.png
```

### Alternative Models

| Model | When to Use | Command |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **flux** | Maximum quality | `--model flux --size 1:1` |
| **gpt-image-1** | Different interpretation | `--model gpt-image-1 --size 1536x1024` |

## The Concept Generation Process

**24-ITEM STORY → NARRATIVE ARC → VISUAL JOURNEY → FLAT EDITORIAL PROMPT → GENERATE**

### The 6-Step Workflow

1. **Run 24-item story explanation** on the content to extract FULL narrative arc
2. **Derive visual metaphor** from ALL 24 items — ONE abstract concept showing TRANSFORMATION/JOURNEY, 2-3 elements
3. **Apply aesthetic** — Flat colors, black linework, white background for transparency
4. **Construct prompt** — Specify hand-drawn, gestural, no gradients, Saul Steinberg style, process/movement
5. **Execute generation** via CLI with --remove-bg flag
6. **Validate** — Flat? Hand-drawn quality? No gradients? Shows journey/process?

**For complete workflow instructions, read:** `workflows/workflow.md`

---

## Prompt Template

```
Editorial conceptual illustration in Saul Steinberg / New Yorker style.

BACKGROUND: Solid flat [CREAM #F5E6D3 | TERRACOTTA #C17A5B | SAGE #A8A89A | PEACH #E8C4A8] — NO gradients.

STYLE: Hand-drawn black ink linework. Variable stroke weight. Imperfect wobbly lines.
Gestural brush quality. NOT smooth vectors. NOT photorealistic. Risograph aesthetic.

COMPOSITION (2-3 elements):
[Describe abstract metaphor with 2-3 simple elements]

NEGATIVE SPACE: 30-40% of image is empty background.
Objects occupy 40-60% of frame.

CRITICAL:
- NO gradients anywhere
- NO shadows
- NO 3D effects
- NO glossy/shiny surfaces
- Lines should be imperfect, hand-drawn quality

Sign "Kai" small in charcoal (#2D2D2D) bottom right corner.
NO other text.
```

## CONCEPT EXAMPLES

These demonstrate the conceptual translation pattern:

### Example: "Leave the Em Dash Alone"
**Narrative Arc (from 24 items):** AI copies human creativity → people react by abandoning what they love → Daniel refuses to be evicted from his own preferences → standing ground on authentic choices
**Visual Concept:** Robot hand and human hand pulling opposite ends of an em dash (tug-of-war) — shows CONFLICT IN PROGRESS
**Why:** Captures the ongoing struggle/ownership battle, not just endpoint

### Example: "Humans Need Entropy"
**Narrative Arc (from 24 items):** Childhood wonder → adult collapse into repetition → discovery that entropy prevents stagnation → actively seeking novelty → renewal cycle
**Visual Concept:** Human head split vertically — left half: dense packed identical circles (collapse); right half: circles scattering outward (entropy dispersing) — shows STATE TRANSFORMATION
**Why:** Captures the before→after transformation journey, duality of states

### Pattern
| Article Theme | Visual Strategy |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Conflict/Ownership | Two forces pulling one object |
| Loss/Absence | Empty spaces that should be full |
| Duality/States | Split composition showing both |
| Collaboration | Hands working together |

---

**The best concepts are immediately readable without explanation, yet reward deeper looking.**
